		<h2>Common Symbols</h2>
		<h3>Astericks</h3>
		<p>Astericks are used to show a sequence that is to be repeated. When anthing is written in astericks, you repeat that sequece until you reach wherever is specified in the pattern. This is usually until you reach the end of the row&bquo; until the certain amount of stitches remains, or until you reach a marker, depending on what the pattern specifies.</p>
		<h3>Parenthesis</h3>
		<p>Patterns usually have modifications for larger sizes written in parentheses. The pattern&rsquo;s default is the smallest size, so if you require a larger size you would have to look at the number in the parenthesis to make your piece correctly.</p>
